# Super-Delete
A blazingly fast alternative to the stock windows folder delete function!

Super-Delete doesn't send files to your recycle bin. It sends it straight to the beautiful world of null! No more "discovering files"! 
By using Super-Delete to delete folders, you could delete large folders in 2-3x the speed of the stock windows delete function!
